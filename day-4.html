                <h1>Thanjavur Temple</h1>
                <p>Brihadishvara Temple, called Rajarajesvaram (lit. 'Lord of Rajaraja') by its builder, and known locally as Thanjai 
                    Periya Kovil (lit. 'Thanjavur Big Temple') and Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a Shaivite[3][4] Hindu temple built in a 
                    Chola architectural style[5] located on the south bank of the Cauvery river in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, 
                    India.[1][6] It is one of the largest Hindu temples and an exemplar of Tamil architecture.[7] 
                    It is also called Dakshina Meru (Meru of the South).[8] Built by Chola emperor Rajaraja I between 1003 and 1010 CE, 
                    the temple is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the "Great Living Chola Temples", 
                    along with the Chola-era Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple and Airavatesvara temple, which are about 70 kilometres 
                    (43 mi) and 40 kilometres (25 mi) to its northeast respectively.[9]</p>

                <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL, 
                    TAHZH -⁠; Hindi: [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') 
                    is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river 
                    Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 
                    1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) 
                    to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses 
                    the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 
                    17-hectare (42-acre) complex,
                     which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal 
                    gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>

            <p> This concluding chapter summarises the main 
                arguments of the book with regards to honorific 
                portraits of the Hellenistic period and places the 
                findings within a broad narrative of the post-Classical
                 city, down to late Antiquity. It highlights the 
                 continued dialectical relationship between community 
                 and elite, within a complicated, conflictual history 
                 of the civic. It considers how elite affirmation in 
                 the Greek cities of the Roman empire took place within 
                 constraints inherited from the Classical and Hellenistic 
                 polis, and which was embodied by the honorific statue. 
                 Taking the honorific statue as a starting point, 
                 the chapter explores the issues of the ‘Greek portrait’ within 
                 an anthropology of Greek art, along with the functions and 
                 the politics of the portrait. Finally, it shows how the political 
                 and artistic approaches can be mapped onto one another to reveal 
                 what honorific 
                statues did, and why they were desirable.</p>
